# OTA Update - Local Server (ESP32 + Flask)

This project demonstrates how to perform **Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates** on an ESP32 using a **local HTTP server** built with Flask.  
It allows you to serve the firmware (`.bin`) file from your PC over Wi-Fi, and the ESP32 can fetch and flash it automatically.

## üöÄ Features
- Local **Flask HTTP server** to host the firmware file.  
- ESP32 OTA update using **ESP-IDF OTA APIs**.  
- Secure Wi-Fi connectivity (ensure ESP32 and server are on the same **2.4 GHz Wi-Fi**).  
- Simple REST API endpoint for firmware delivery.  
- Optional HTTPS support for secure transfer.  
- Example **OTA client code** included.
